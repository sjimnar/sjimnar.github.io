It involves emptying an S3 bucket through batch deletion and then uploading a ransom note. This attack leverages the <code>DeleteObjects</code> API to remove multiple objects at once, making it efficient for large-scale deletion.</p>"},{"location":"aws.impact.s3-ransomware-batch-deletion-blog/#detailed-steps","title":"Detailed Steps","text":"<ol> <li>Listing Objects: The attack starts by listing all objects and their versions in the target S3 bucket using the <code>ListObjectVersions</code> API.</li> <li>Batch Deletion: It then deletes all these objects in a single request using the S3 <code>DeleteObjects</code> API. This API can delete up to 1000 objects at a time.</li> <li> <p>Ransom Note: Finally, the attack uploads a ransom note to the bucket, typically named <code>FILES-DELETED.txt</code>, informing the victim that their data has been \"backed up\" and providing contact information for negotiating its recovery. The content of the ransom note might look like this:</p> <p><code>text Your data is backed up in a safe location. To negotiate with us for recovery, get in touch with rick@astley.io. In 7 days, if we don't hear from you, that data will either be sold or published, and might no longer be recoverable.'</code></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"aws.impact.s3-ransomware-batch-deletion-blog/#mitigation-strategies","title":"Mitigation Strategies","text":"<ul> <li>Monitoring and Alerting: Set up monitoring and alerting to detect unusual deletion patterns.</li> </ul> <p>To protect against this type of ransomware attack, consider the following mitigation strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Versioning: Enable S3 versioning to keep a history of all object versions.</li> <li>MFA Delete: Require multi-factor authentication for deleting object versions.</li> <li>Bucket Policies: Implement strict bucket policies to control access and restrict deletion permissions.</li> </ul>"}]}
