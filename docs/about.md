# About Me

Hello! I'm Sergio Jimenez, and this is my blog dedicated to AWS security.

I am passionate about cloud security, particularly in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. My goal with this blog is to share insights, analysis, and countermeasures related to various security techniques and attack patterns in AWS.

I often draw inspiration from resources like [Stratus Red Team](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/) to explore and explain complex security scenarios, helping to disseminate knowledge and provide practical mitigation strategies.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjnar/) or join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/RYwhuSXx) to discuss AWS security topics.
